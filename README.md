Project title
Patient Health Monitoring and Risk Alert System

Overview of the project
This project is a Python program for managing patient health data including blood pressure, blood sugar, BMI, and age. It loads and saves patient records to a CSV file, allows adding new patients, updating vitals, and generates individual patient risk reports based on predefined health thresholds. It also lists high-risk patients for easier monitoring.

Features
Load/save patient data from/to CSV file
Add new patient records with relevant health parameters
Update patient vital signs
Calculate health risk status based on blood pressure, sugar levels, BMI, and age
Generate detailed patient health report
List all patients flagged as high risk

Technologies/tools used
Python programming language
CSV module for file handling
Command line interface for user interaction
Steps to install & run the project
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Save the provided Python script to a file, e.g., patient_risk.py.
Place it in a working directory where patient data file (patients.csv) will be stored.
Run the script from command line: python patient_risk.py.

Instructions for testing
Use the menu options to add sample patient data with varying blood pressure, sugar, BMI, and age values.
Select the report option to verify correct risk classification.
Update patient vitals and check if changes reflect correctly in reports.
Add multiple patients to test the high-risk listing feature.
Confirm that data is saved correctly on exit and persists on subsequent runs.
