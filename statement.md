Problem statement
Managing patient health records and assessing their health risks in clinics or small hospitals is often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Rapid identification of high-risk individuals based on vitals (blood pressure, sugar level, BMI, age) is crucial to ensure timely medical attention, which current manual systems fail to provide efficiently.

Scope of the project
This project is designed to automate the collection, storage, and risk assessment of patient health data. It provides a command-line interface for healthcare workers to easily add, update, and review patient vitals, generate individual risk profiles, and maintain persistent health records through CSV files. The system flags high-risk patients for fast action and helps streamline routine reporting and monitoring tasks in clinics or community healthcare centers.

Target users
Clinic staff and healthcare workers needing to manage patient data efficiently
Small-to-medium healthcare facilities with limited digital infrastructure
Local health outreach teams conducting health screenings in communities
Medical students and educators needing a risk-assessment demo project

High-level features
Automated loading and saving of patient data
Efficient entry and updating of patient vital statistics
Instant calculation of health risk category per patient
Option to generate individual patient risk reports
Listing feature to display all high-risk patients
Persistent record keeping using CSV files
Simple command-line interface suitable for non-technical users
